# Next.js Frontend Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a Next.js frontend project, including installing Node.js and Git, cloning the project, installing dependencies, running the project, setting up the `.env` file, and understanding the available routes based on user roles.

---

## 1. **Install Node.js and Git**

### Where to Install Node.js

- Download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.
- After installation, verify the installation by running:
  
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

### Where to Install Git

- Download and install Git from the official website: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
- Verify the installation by running:
  
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

---

## 2. **Clone the Project Using Git**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the project:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

4. Navigate into the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder-name>
   ```

---

## 3. **Install Dependencies Using Node**

1. Make sure you are in the project's root directory.
2. Run the following command to install all dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   This will install all the packages listed in the `package.json` file.

---

## 4. **Run the Frontend**

1. After installing dependencies, start the development server by running:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the frontend.

---

## 5. **Setting Up the `.env` File**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add environment variables to the `.env` file. For example:
   
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
   ```
3. Make sure to prefix your environment variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` if you want them to be accessible in the browser.
